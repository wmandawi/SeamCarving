 *  Give a formula (using tilde notation) for the running time 
 *  (in seconds) required to reduce image size by one row and a formula
 *  for the running time required to reduce image size by one column. 
 *  Both should be functions of W and H. Removal should involve exactly
 *  one call to the appropriate find method and one call to the 
 *  appropriate remove method. The randomPicture() method in SCUtility 
 *  may be useful.
 * 
 *  Justify your answer with sufficient data using large enough 
 *  W and H values. To dampen system effects, you may wish to perform
 *  many trials for a given value of W and H and average the results.
 *  
 *  Be sure to give the leading coefficient and the value of the exponents 
 *  as a fraction with 2 decimal places. And show your calculations.
